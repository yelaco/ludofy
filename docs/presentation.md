### **Proposed Expanded Presentation Structure**

#### **1. Introduction (Set the Stage)**

- **Objective**: Briefly introduce the focus of your thesisâ€”designing gaming backends and comparing architectures.
- **Why It Matters**:
  - Highlight the significance of backend architecture in modern gaming (e.g., scalability, performance).
  - Mention challenges faced by traditional backend systems.

#### **2. Traditional Game Backend (Establish a Baseline)**

- **Overview**:
  - Explain the typical architecture (dedicated servers, monolithic designs).
  - Mention common technologies (e.g., custom game servers, load balancers, databases).
- **Challenges**:
  - Scalability issues during peak loads.
  - High maintenance costs and effort.
  - Inefficient use of resources (idle servers during low activity).
  - Real-life example: A case study or well-known game that faced scaling issues.

#### **3. Serverless Architecture (Introduce the Shift)**

- **Concept**:
  - Define serverless architecture and its benefits (scalability, cost-effectiveness, reduced operational complexity).
  - Explain the "pay-as-you-go" model.
- **Core Components**:
  - Functions as a Service (e.g., AWS Lambda).
  - Event-driven workflows.
  - Managed databases and APIs.
- **Why Serverless in Gaming?**:
  - Address gaming backend challenges:
    - Handling traffic spikes.
    - Cost efficiency for variable workloads.
    - Focus on game logic instead of infrastructure.

#### **4. Serverless in Gaming Backend**

- **Applications**:
  - Matchmaking.
  - Game state management.
  - Leaderboards.
  - Real-time analytics.
- **Challenges**:
  - Cold starts, state management, latency.
- **Real-Life Examples**:
  - Mention games or companies using serverless for their backend.

#### **5. Fully Serverless vs Hybrid Architectures (High-Level View)**

- **Fully Serverless**:
  - Define and provide use cases (e.g., turn-based games like chess).
  - Pros: Scalability, cost-efficiency, simplicity.
  - Cons: Latency in real-time games, stateless nature.
- **Hybrid**:
  - Define and provide use cases (e.g., real-time games like battle royale).
  - Pros: Optimized for real-time performance.
  - Cons: Increased complexity and operational overhead.
- **Comparison Table**:
  - Summarize trade-offs in a clear and visual format.

#### **6. Design and Implementation of Fully Serverless Chess Platform Backend**

- **Objective**:
  - Explain why chess is suitable for a fully serverless backend.
- **Architecture Overview**:
  - Present a diagram of the fully serverless backend.
  - Highlight components:
    - Authentication.
    - Game logic (move validation, turn management).
    - Game state storage.
    - Matchmaking and leaderboards.
- **Workflow**:
  - Explain step-by-step how a typical interaction (e.g., starting a game, making a move, game completion) is handled.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - AWS services (e.g., Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito, API Gateway).
- **Challenges and Solutions**:
  - Discuss issues faced during design and implementation (e.g., cold starts, game state persistence).
  - How you resolved or mitigated them.

#### **7. Evaluation and Results**

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Latency, throughput, and scalability under simulated workloads.
- **Cost Analysis**:
  - Compare serverless costs vs traditional/hybrid approaches.
- **Insights**:
  - Key takeaways from testing and deployment.

#### **8. Discussion**

- **Strengths of Your Backend**:
  - Scalability, cost-effectiveness, simplicity.
- **Limitations**:
  - Explain areas for improvement (e.g., better handling of abandoned games).
- **Future Work**:
  - Suggest extending the architecture for other types of games (e.g., multiplayer real-time).
  - Explore integration of edge computing or AI-driven matchmaking.

#### **9. Conclusion**

- Summarize:
  - The evolution from traditional to serverless backends.
  - Your contributions (design and implementation of a fully serverless chess backend).
  - Key findings and lessons learned.
- Emphasize:
  - The flexibility of serverless for specific gaming scenarios.
  - The complementary nature of hybrid architectures for real-time gaming.

#### **10. Q&A**

- End with a simple "Thank You" slide and open the floor for questions.

### **Additional Suggestions**

1. **Visuals**:

   - Use diagrams, flowcharts, and comparison tables wherever possible.
   - Include a high-level architecture diagram for the fully serverless backend.
   - Add graphs for performance metrics and cost analysis.

2. **Real-Life References**:

   - If possible, include examples of companies or games using serverless or hybrid architectures.
   - Quote relevant statistics or benchmarks.

3. **Engage the Audience**:

   - Start with a relatable scenario (e.g., "Imagine 10,000 players joining your game at once").
   - Use interactive visuals or animations for workflows.

4. **Technical Depth**:

   - Ensure a balance between technical details and general concepts.
   - Adapt the depth of explanation based on the audience's expertise.

5. **Time Management**:
   - Practice delivering each section to ensure your presentation stays within the allocated time.
